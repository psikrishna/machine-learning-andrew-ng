# Machine Learning on Coursera

Instructor: [Andrew Ng](https://www.andrewng.org/)

## Introduction

This repository contains all the working codes for the programming assignments in the machine learning course: [Machine learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome)

## What I want to say

As a CS/IT under-grad student and a long-time self-taught learner, I have taken many courses from these online platforms. So, I know it is not an easy task to understand all the concepts in the course, the process of writing the algorithm and debugging one's code.

In this repository, there are solutions, which are **only for your reference purpose**. These might help one in saving one's time but my advice is restrain from copying the code, understand the algorithm and then implement it in your own way.

And in case of any bug, doubt, etc, feel free to raise an issue (or even hit-me-up if you know me).
